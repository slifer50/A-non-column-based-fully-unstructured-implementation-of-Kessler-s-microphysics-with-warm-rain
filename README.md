This repository includes the following:

Data: This Folder contains the Data obtained from the Squall line and Super cell simulations separated into multiple directories depending on 
spatial resolution and whether CG or DG spectral elements are used, the Data_links file contains google drive links to the larger VTK files that could not
be fit onto the repository.

figures: Includes all figures present in the Manuscript of Tissaoui et al 2022:A non column based fully unstructured implementation of Kessler's 
microphysics with warm rain using continuous and discontinuous spectral elements.

Relevant_NUMA_code: Contains the Fortran code used for the non-column-based Kessler microphysics implementation as extracted from the Nonhydrostatic
Unified Model of the atmosphere (NUMA).
